# SEA Catering ‚Äì Smart Meal Subscription App üç±

**SEA Catering** is a full-stack web application designed to simplify healthy meal subscription services for users. It allows users to register, log in, choose meal plans (such as Diet, Protein, or Royal Plans), customize delivery days and meal types, and subscribe with just a few clicks.

This app is ideal for busy individuals who want consistent, nutritious food without the hassle of ordering daily. It also includes role-based dashboards for both regular users and administrators.

- Secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Frontend-backend communication using HTTP requests
- Protected API routes
- Dynamic UI components for a modern user experience

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js (with JSX)
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - Axios & Fetch API (for HTTP requests)
  - SweetAlert2 (for modal confirmations and alerts)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js with Express.js
  - MySQL (Relational Database)
  - JWT (Authentication)
  - dotenv (Environment variable management)

- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript (React JSX on frontend, Node.js on backend)

- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode)  
  Recommended Extensions:
  - Prettier ‚Äì Code Formatter  
  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense  
  - ESLint  
  - React Snippets

## üßæ How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sea-catering.git
cd sea-catering
```

---

### 2. Setup Backend (Node.js)

```bash
cd sea-catering-backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `sea-catering-backend/`:

```
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=sea_catering
```

Then run the backend:

- All protected API routes use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers
- The backend checks token validity via middleware before accessing protected resources
